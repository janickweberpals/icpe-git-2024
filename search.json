    "text": "About\nTransparency and reproducibility are major prerequisites for conducting meaningful real-world evidence (RWE) studies that are fit for decision-making. With HARPER and RECORD-PE, many advances have been made in the documentation and reporting of study protocols, study parameters, and results, but the principles for computational reproducibility of study results, version control and sharing of analytic code in RWE are not yet as established as in other quantitative disciplines like computational biology and health informatics, where there are potentially fewer barriers.\nAs many stakeholders (funding agencies, journals, regulators, data providers) increasingly require a transparent audit trail of all steps of a RWE study and reproducible analytic source code, this warrants pharmacoepidemiologists to upskill and implement reproducible workflows as routine practice. This course aims to give an introduction on practical study design templates (HARPER) and tools (git, quarto) to increase the transparency and reproducibility across the design, analysis and reporting stages of a RWE study.",
