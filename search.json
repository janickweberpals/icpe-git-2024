    "text": "About\nTransparency and reproducibility are major prerequisites for conducting meaningful real-world evidence (RWE) studies that are fit for decision-making. With HARPER and RECORD-PE, many advances have been made in the documentation and reporting of study protocols, study parameters, and results, but the principles for computational reproducibility of study results, version control and sharing of analytic code in RWE are not yet as established as in other quantitative disciplines like computational biology and health informatics, where there are potentially fewer barriers.\nAs many stakeholders (funding agencies, journals, regulators, data providers) increasingly require a transparent audit trail of all steps of a RWE study and reproducible analytic source code, this warrants pharmacoepidemiologists to upskill and implement reproducible workflows as routine practice. This course aims to give an introduction on practical study design templates (HARPER) and tools (git, quarto) to increase the transparency and reproducibility across the design, analysis and reporting stages of a RWE study.",

    "text": "3.1 HARPER\nAmbiguity in communication of key study parameters limits the utility of real-world evidence (RWE) studies in healthcare decision-making. The International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology and ISPOR (The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research) convened a joint task force to create a harmonized protocol template for RWE studies. The template builds on existing efforts to improve transparency and incorporates recent insights regarding the level of detail needed to enable study reproducibility.\nThe overarching principle was to reach for sufficient clarity to achieve three main goals. One, to help investigators thoroughly consider, then document their choices and rationale for key study parameters that define the causal question, two, to facilitate decision-making by enabling reviewers to readily assess potential for biases related to these choices, and three, to facilitate reproducibility. The HARmonized Protocol Template to Enhance Reproducibility helps to create a shared understanding of intended scientific decisions through a common text, tabular and visual structure. The template provides a set of core recommendations for clear and reproducible RWE study protocols and is intended to be used as a backbone throughout the research process from developing a valid study protocol, to registration, through implementation and reporting on those implementation decisions.",
